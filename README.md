# MNIST Convolutional Neural Network Example

This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Keras. The example is designed to provide an easy-to-understand template for beginners interested in deep learning and computer vision.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the goal is to classify the digit (0-9) represented in each image.

This example:
- Preprocesses the MNIST dataset for use with a neural network.
- Builds a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using the Keras Sequential API.
- Trains the model on the MNIST dataset.
- Evaluates the model's performance on the test set.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- Keras (usually included with TensorFlow)

To install the required dependencies, use:
bash
pip install tensorflow


## How to Run the Example

1. Clone the repository:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mnist_convnet.git
    cd mnist_convnet
    

2. Run the script:
    bash
    python mnist_convnet.py
    

3. Monitor the training process. The model will be trained for several epochs, with accuracy and loss displayed for each epoch.

4. After training, the script will evaluate the model on the test dataset and display the final accuracy.

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture used in this example includes the following layers:

- *Input Layer*: Accepts 28x28 grayscale images.
- *Convolutional Layer*: Extracts features using filters.
- *Max Pooling Layer*: Reduces the spatial dimensions.
- *Flatten Layer*: Flattens the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
- *Dense Layer*: Fully connected layer for learning complex patterns.
- *Output Layer*: A dense layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) and a softmax activation function.

## Results

With this model, you can achieve a test accuracy of approximately 99% after training for a few epochs.

Example output:

Epoch 5/5
60000/60000 [==============================] - 4s 75us/step - loss: 0.0184 - accuracy: 0.9946
Test accuracy: 99.1%


## Customization

Feel free to modify the following:
- Number of convolutional or dense layers.
- Filters, kernel sizes, or activation functions.
- Learning rate or optimizer.
- Batch size and number of epochs.
